### Data Features
  - ID: Patient ID
  - PRG: Plasma glucose
  - PL: Blood Work Result-1
  - PR: Blood Pressure
  - SK: Blood Work Result-2
  - TS: Blood Work Result-3
  - M11: Body mass index
  - BD2: Blood Work Result-4
  - Age: Patient's age
  - Insurance: Insurance status (binary)
  - Sepsis: Target variable (Positive or Negative)

### Preprocessing

- **Handling Missing Values:** No missing values were found in the dataset.

- **Handling Duplicate Values:** No duplicate values were found in the dataset.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- **Data Shape:**
  - Training Dataset: (599, 11)
  - Testing Dataset: (169, 10)

- **Descriptive Statistics:**
  - Descriptive statistics were computed to provide insights into the distribution and characteristics of numeric features within the dataset. 
  - Based on the mean, median, and visual inspection, features like 'PL' (Blood Work Result-1) and 'PR' (Blood Pressure) appear to have distributions that are closer to normal, with symmetric shapes. Other features exhibit skewness to varying degrees.
  - Checked Outliers : Boxplots helped to identify the presence of outliers in each numeric variable. Out of the variables, blood work result-3 (TS) and blood work result-4 (BD2) had a lot of outliers specifically, above the maximum whiskers. Blood Pressure (PR) and Body Mass Index (M11)  had outliers at both sides of the whiskers. Blood Work Result-2 (SK) and Blood Work Result-1 (PL) had only one outlier outside the whiskers.

  **Outlier Detection:**
  - Identified outliers in numeric variables using box plots.
  Blood work result-3 (TS) and blood work result-4 (BD2) had a lot of outliers specifically, above the maximum whiskers. Blood Pressure (PR) and Body Mass Index (M11)  had outliers at both sides of the whiskers. Blood Work Result-2 (SK) and Blood Work Result-1 (PL) had only one outlier outside the whiskers.

- **Univariate Analysis:**
  - The distribution of the target column Sepsis was investigated:
    There was a higher count of negative cases compared to positive cases in 'Sepsis'. 

- **Bivariate Analysis:**
  - The relationship between numeric variables was investigated. This exploration helped uncover potential correlations or patterns between pairs of features, contributing to a more comprehensive understanding of the dataset.
  - There was a positive correlation between 'PRG' and 'Age', indicating that as plasma glucose increases, age tends to increase as well. 'PL' and 'TS' also showed a positive correlation. â€˜SK' and 'Age' had a negative correlation, indicating that as blood work result-2 decreases, age tends to increase. Some variables showed weak correlations close to zero, such as 'M11' and 'Insurance'.

  
## Data Analysis 
### Univariate and Bivariate Analysis
These were the questions that guided the study.

1. **What is the distribution of plasma glucose levels in the dataset?**
   - The distribution of PRG levels in the dataset is right-skewed, with a higher frequency of lower values (towards the left side of the histogram).

2. **Is there a significant difference in plasma glucose levels between patients who    develop sepsis and those who do not?**
   - The Mann-Whitney U test, also known as the Wilcoxon rank-sum test, is a non-parametric statistical test used to assess whether there is a difference between two independent, non-normally distributed groups.
   - **Result of Mann-Whitney U test:**
   - This suggests that there is evidence supporting the idea that plasma glucose levels differ between patients who develop sepsis and those who do not.

3. **What is the average BMI among patients who develop sepsis?**
   - The histogram helped to visualize the distribution of Body Mass Index (BMI) among patients who developed sepsis.
   - **Result:**
   - The average BMI of 35.39 suggests the typical BMI among patients who developed sepsis. 

4. **Is there a difference in body mass index (BMI) between patients with and without sepsis?**
   - The Mann-Whitney U test assesses whether there is a significant difference in Body Mass Index (BMI) between patients with and without sepsis.
   - **Result of Mann-Whitney U test:**
   - There is evidence supporting the idea that BMI values differ between patients who developed sepsis and those who did not.

5. **Is there a specific age range where the likelihood of sepsis is higher?**
   - This analysis explores whether there is a specific age range where the likelihood of sepsis is higher.
   - **Result:**
   - Each row in the table corresponds to an age group, and the columns indicate the percentage of patients with and without sepsis in each group. In age groups 20-29, 30-39, 40-49, and 50-59, the percentage of patients with sepsis is higher than in the older age groups. Notably, in the 70-79 and 80-89 age groups, there are no patients with sepsis based on the dataset.

6. **Is the impact of insurance status on sepsis likelihood consistent across different age groups?**
   - The stacked bar chart helped to visualize the distribution of sepsis cases across different age groups, considering insurance status.
   - **Result:**
   - The stacked bar chart displays the distribution of sepsis cases across different age groups, with a further breakdown based on insurance status (Positive or Negative). In the 20-29, 30-39, and 60-69 age groups, the proportion of sepsis cases appeared higher among patients without insurance compared to those with insurance. In the age groups 40-49 and 50-59, the proportion of sepsis cases appeared higher among patients with insurance compared to those without insurance.

### Multivariate Analysis - Logistic Regression
   - Logistic regression was used to analyse the hypothesis stated. 
   - **Logistic regression** is a type of multiple regression used for predicting binary outcomes, and it is a suitable approach for analyzing the impact of multiple predictor variables (independent variables) on a binary categorical target variable (dependent variable).
   - The logistic regression model showed that the p-values for Age, Plasma Glucose (PRG), and Body Mass Index (M11) were less than the alpha value(0.01). This implies that they are statistically significant predictors of the likelihood of Sepsis.
   - Based on the results, we rejected the null hypothesis and concluded that Age, Plasma Glucose (PRG) and Body Mass Index (M11) have a statistically significant impact on the likelihood of Sepsis.

## Modeling

### Machine Learning Models

In this project, several machine learning models were trained and evaluated to predict the likelihood of sepsis based on various features in the dataset. The best model was chosen for further prdictions on unseen data.

1. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classifier:**
   - Trained the first model using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classifier.
   - Achieved an overall accuracy of 71% on the test set.
   - Demonstrated moderate performance with imbalances in precision and recall for the two classes.

2. **Logistic Regression (Gradient Descent):**
   - Trained the second model using Logistic Regression with Gradient Descent.
   - Achieved an overall accuracy of 75% on the test set.
   - Showed improved performance compared to KNN, with balanced precision and recall.

3. **Decision Tree (Decision Tree):**
   - Trained the third model using the Decision Tree algorithm.
   - Achieved an overall accuracy of 73% on the test set.
   - Exhibited reasonable performance with an accuracy of 73%.

   - Showed moderate performance with balanced precision and recall.

7. **Neural Network (TensorFlow and Keras):**
   - Trained the last model using a Neural Network.
   - Achieved an overall accuracy of 70% on the test set.
   - Demonstrated moderate performance with a balanced accuracy of 70%.

### Summary of Classification Reports

- The following metrics provide a comprehensive view of each classifier's performance, considering precision, accuracy, recall, and F1-Score. Logistic regression showed a balanced performance across these metrics, making it a strong candidate for predicting the likelihood of sepsis. 

## Balance the Class in Sepsis
- Class weight was used to address the the class imbalance in sepsis. All the seven models were trained again using class weights. This is to ensures that the model pays more attention to the minority class, potentially improving its ability to correctly predict instances of the minority class.

### Summary Report of Models using Class Weights
- The Logistic Regression model with class weights performed best with precision of 75.4%, recall of 72.5%, F1-Score of 73.1% and accuracy of 72.5%. This model shows a good balance between precision and recall, making it a suitable choice for predicting the likelihood of sepsis. 

## Hyperparameter Tuning
Hyperparameter Tuning systematically searches for the best set of hyperparameters for the algorithm to optimize its performance. It improves the model's performance and also controls the complexity of the model.
- Utilized grid search for hyperparameter tuning on the Logistic Regression model.
- Best hyperparameters: {'C': 1, 'penalty': 'l1', 'solver': 'liblinear'}

## Making Predictions on Test Data
The logistic regression model, as the best-performing model, demonstrates its effectiveness in distinguishing between patients with and without sepsis. 

- The metrics showed a balanced classification across both classes, with a weighted precision of 74.8%, weighted recall of 72.5%, and a weighted F1-score of 73.0%. The model demonstrates robust performance in predicting the likelihood of sepsis, considering both positive and negative instances.

## Saved Pipeline and Encoder
The model's pipeline and encoder were saved to be used for further predictions on unseen data.
